This is my emacs configuration.
===============================

Copy files to anywhere you want, then make ~/.emacs symbolic link to
init-file.el.  As a alternative, you can use `load-file' function to
load init-file.el in the ~/.emacs file.

`emacs-config-dir' is the directory hold emacs config files.
`emacs-doc-dir' is the directory hold some documents for emacs, such
as bookmarks, diary, and so on.

You can change your `emacs-config-dir' and `emacs-doc-dir' in the
`dir-setting.el' under the same directory of init-file.el.
