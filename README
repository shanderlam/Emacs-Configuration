This is my emacs configuration.

Copy files to anywhere you want, then make ~/.emacs symbolic link to init-file.el.
Config your `emacs-config-dir' and `emacs-doc-dir'.
`emacs-config-dir' is the directory hold emacs config files.
`emacs-doc-dir' is the directory hold some documents for emacs, such as bookmarks, diary, and so on.
